Types of bad links from nees.org

On Nov 18, 2012, we ran linkcheck on https://nees.org. linkcheck was run as a
user not logged into the website from a hubzero.org workspace container. A
summary of results follows:

datafile: nees.org_linkdata_1353259505.tgz
Run Time: about 35 hours
Exit Status: successfull
pages checked: 17697
urls checked: 19763
Unique 404 Error Urls: 74
Total 404 Error: 322
linkcheck flags: --ignore /warehouse/filebrowser --delay 0.5 --locators nees


Breakdown of unique 404 links by type:

1. Phone number links

Example : https://nees/org/members/1142
key : ScuQH1_HYi6k91q3UK7L7EOEf2-BGok8PaMNoAQzG7g=
link_text : 989-708-0580
target : https://nees.org/989-708-0580

If a user is on a mobile device, and a phone number is available in the user
profile, the user would be able to click the link of the phone number and the
mobile device can call the number. The errror occurs when the user is viewing
the user profile in a web browser on a non-mobile device. The linked phone
number leads to a 404 page. Even on a mobile device, (mozilla firefox mobile
nightly), the links lead to 404 pages.

to identify this type of link, look for a locator of this form:
css=ul#profile > li:nth-child(3) > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(2) > a:nth-child(1)
css=a.phone

16 links





2. Bread crumb links

Example : https://nees.org/resources/770
key : x8k1jtO1um4aLhXPehbEFwvC5HW3dhMLksxp2P4zDd0=
link_text : Active Documents
target : https://nees.org/groups/app-epet1/resources?area=activedocuments

to identify this type of link, look for a locator of this form:
css=div#trail

https://nees.org/groups/app-epet1/resources?area=activedocuments
https://nees.org/content
https://nees.org/wishlist/add?category=&rid=0
https://nees.org/groups/app-epet1/resources

4 links




3. hard coded download links

Example : https://nees.org/simulation
key : rNpaoiHssVs_abwhkf6_vTxArvz6-9Inr2wWTE5KxXY=
link_text :
target : https://nees.org/resources/942/download/Deepsoilv3_7_setup.msi

this link was hard coded with the version number embedded in the link. when the
version was upgraded, the file was removed and the link was broken. might want to use
a template file name like Deepsoilv*.msi and sort on filename.


to identify this type of link, look for a locator of this form:


https://nees.org/resources/942/download/Deepsoilv3_7_setup.msi

1 link





4.1 out of site referral links

Example : https://nees.org/education/cmmi-poster-session-main
key : AEiT2mRgdUppkKrdTKmwyKJJYizCYR21zCKD_669OuQ=
link is an image
target : https://nees.org/eot.neeshub.org/CMI

this was a link to another website, eot.neeshub.org/CMI. we believe the bad
link was introduced to the site through the custom text input widget on the
resource contribution page.




https://nees.org/eot.neeshub.org/CMI
https://nees.org/www.ruf.rice.edu/~dsg%20target=
https://nees.org/users.nees.utexas.edu/songcheng/

3 links


4.2 out of site referral links with quotes

Example : https://nees.org/resources/frame3dd
key : UABmvzQRp6G9GlC_Qv279ENMVi_BlWKrzlsCwYGeHbQ=
link is an image
target : https://nees.org/resources/%5C%22http://www.vim.org/%5C%22

the wiki text editor widget used by nees adds double quotes around the link
%5C%22 is the double quote.


to identify this type of link, look %5C%22  or %22 in link url.

5. bad links on error pages

Example : https://nees.org/resources/about/contact
key : gz0cxScGLja7nt0O0vLQYblWZu4e6FU8F7Vwi1XMYio=
link : Contact Us
target : https://nees.org/resources/about/contact

Footer links on error pages lead to 404 error pages themselves.
This seems to be unique to nees.org, perhaps when they changed
their error page handler, there was a mistake in the way footer
urls were created. The urls always have the same base as the error page they came from.


to identify this type of link, look for a locator starting with div#footer and
the parent and target having the same base url. ex:
https://nees.org/resources/4332 -> https://nees.org/resources/legal/terms.
Also check if the parent_url is displaying an error code, any footer link will
be incorrect.

key : mdrsYmmd16f6bi3GZH-XdSi8WnpJodSToMQpmmNv0vc=
link : here
target: https://nees.org/for-students/reu-program/neesreulearningmodules
