%  This is the BibTeX data file for a simple, example thesis.
%
%  I like to order the entries by author, and within author by year.
%  If, for example, I later added a second 1994 publication for Goossens,
%  I would give it the key, ``Goossens:1994b''.

abstract={Purdue University operates one of the largest cycle recovery systems in existence in academia based on the Condor workload management system. This system represents a valuable and useful cyberinfrastructure (CI) resource supporting research and education for campus and national users. During the construction and operation of this CI, we encountered many unforeseen challenges and benefits unique to an actively used infrastructure of this size. The most significant problems were integrating Condor with existing campus UPC resources, managing resource and user growth, coping with the distributed ownership of compute resources around campus, and integrating this CI with the Tera- Gridand Open Science Grid. In this paper, we describe some of our experiences and establish some best practices, which we believe will be valuable and useful to other academic institutions seeking to operate a production campus cyberinfrastrucure of a similar scale and utility.},

OSG provides support for and evolution of the infrastructure through activities that cover operations, security, software, troubleshooting, addition of new capabilities, and support for existing and engagement with new communities. The OSG SciDAC-2 project provides specific activities to manage and evolve the distributed infrastructure and support it's use. The innovative aspects of the project are the maintenance and performance of a collaborative (shared & common) petascale national facility over tens of autonomous computing sites, for many hundreds of users, transferring terabytes of data a day, executing tens of thousands of jobs a day, and providing robust and usable resources for scientific groups of all types and sizes. More information can be found at the OSG web site: www.opensciencegrid.org.}

abstract={Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), TeraGrid is one of the world's largest distributed cyberinfrastructures for open scientific research. The project began in 2001 as the Distributed Tera-scale Facility, which linked computers, visualization systems, and data at four sites through a dedicated 40-gigabit optical network. Today TeraGrid includes 25 platforms at 11 sites and provides access to more than a petaflop of computing power and petabytes of storage. TeraGrid has three primary focus areas. Its deep goal is to support the most challenging computational science activities those that cannot be achieved without TeraGrid facilities. TeraGrid's wide mission is to broaden its user base. The project's open goal is to achieve compatibility with peer grids and information services that allow development of programmatic interfaces to TeraGrid. The Science Gateways program seeks to provide researchers with easy access to TeraGrid's high-performance computing resources. A look at four successful gateways illustrates the program's goals, challenges, and opportunities.},
